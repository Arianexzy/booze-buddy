Ideas:
- change color screen to get darker with each drink like the scheme for karate belts
- having a slider to "call it a night" instead of a button
    - or hold the button down for a few seconds
- change BAC color 

- Achievements:
    - stack the achievements as they accumulate in the Tonight view
    - in the Achievement view, keep track of what achievements have been made and how many times
