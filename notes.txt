Ideas:
- change BAC color

- Dynamic background color will have like a gradient shade of the Rainbow spectrum
    - Starting at Violet, there will be a gradient of Violet at the top and Indigo at the bottom
    - On each drink, the background will change gradient color to the next Rainbow color like:
        - V/V, I/v, B/i, G/b, Y/g, O/y, R/o, R/R
        - Lower case letter represents being the recessive color (just being the bottom gradient part)
        - Last color will be pure red
        - ** Use the colors from the System Monitor tool that are used for the CPU's
            - Click on a CPU color, then right-click on the checked color and click "Customize"

- Achievements:
    - stack the achievements as they accumulate in the Tonight view
    - in the Achievement view, keep track of what achievements have been made and how many times

- Consider using the Ciggy Buddy button instead.

- Convert ounces to liters and pounds to kilograms for the BAC calc

- only need to save one set of user data.  Just overwrite the old data with the new data.

- settings.json file is not work ****
