Ideas:

- Dynamic background color will have like a gradient shade of the Rainbow spectrum
    - Starting at Violet, there will be a gradient of Violet at the top and Indigo at the bottom
    - On each drink, the background will change gradient color to the next Rainbow color like:
        - V/V, I/v, B/i, G/b, Y/g, O/y, R/o, R/R
        - Lower case letter represents being the recessive color (just being the bottom gradient part)
        - Last color will be pure red
        - ** Use the colors from the System Monitor tool that are used for the CPU's
            - Click on a CPU color, then right-click on the checked color and click "Customize"

- Achievements:
    - stack the achievements as they accumulate in the Tonight view
    - in the Achievement view, keep track of what achievements have been made and how many times

- Consider using the Ciggy Buddy button instead.

- Convert ounces to liters and pounds to kilograms for the BAC calc

- Need to add some information about how the BAC is used and calculated so the User is aware of how that works. 

- Definitely need to rework the BAC calc. The hour since last drink thing seems to be draining the BAC way too fast. 
- I need to somehow let the user start up a new session. Otherwise, my BAC calc will be way off especially with the time since last drink calc. 

- I want more variety ranges in the BAC color scheme. It takes too many drinks to hit later levels. 

- Clicking the navbar icons is causing that weird blue box to show and it looks glitchy.
- Let's have the navbar icons be grayed out when they are not selected

- Take a new approach to the end button. Once the user starts a session by adding a drink, the end button will pop up
