- Achievements:
    - stack the achievements as they accumulate in the Tonight view
    - in the Achievement view, keep track of what achievements have been made and how many times
    - Put in a peak BAC
    
- Put in a peak BAC with the History stats 

- Convert ounces to liters and pounds to kilograms for the BAC calc or give the option in settings

- Need to add some information about how the BAC is used and calculated so the User is aware of how that works. 

- Definitely need to rework the BAC calc. The hour since last drink thing seems to be draining the BAC way too fast. 

- Fix the gray bar at the top that other apps dont have

- Put the Total drinks and BAC stats on a single line

- Fix the witty messages.  Many many more need to be added and/or adjusted.
