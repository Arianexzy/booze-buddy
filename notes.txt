Ideas:
- change color screen to get darker with each drink like the scheme for karate belts
- having a slider to "call it a night" instead of a button
    - or hold the button down for a few seconds
- change BAC color 

- Dynamic background color will have like a gradient shade of the Rainbow spectrum
    - Starting at Violet, there will be a gradient of Violet at the top and Indigo at the bottom
    - On each drink, the background will change gradient color to the next Rainbow color like:
        - V/V, I/v, B/i, G/b, Y/g, O/y, R/o, R/R   
        - Lower case letter represents being the recessive color (just being the bottom gradient part)
        - Last color will be pure red

- Achievements:
    - stack the achievements as they accumulate in the Tonight view
    - in the Achievement view, keep track of what achievements have been made and how many times

- Tonight View:
    - Add plus and minus buttons to the right of the four drink buttons.
